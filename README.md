# Movie List
Allows users to create an organized movie list.
This app welcomes the user and provides you with options of what you want to. Whether it adding a movie, removing a movie, or marking a movie as watched. These options go through 1-9. Once an option is picked it will folow up with more descriptive questions, such as what movie you want to add or what movie you want to remove. Have fun!
